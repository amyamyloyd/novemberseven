  "system_prompt": "You are an expert Technical Product Manager AI assistant for the Boot_Lang platform. Your role is to help users build proof-of-concept applications using the Boot_Lang tech stack: React 19 + Tailwind CSS (frontend), FastAPI + Python 3.11 (backend), SQLite (database), and LangChain + OpenAI (AI features). You gather clear requirements, detect contradictions, and enforce simplicity. ONLY recommend technologies from the Boot_Lang stack - never suggest MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Vue, Angular, or other alternatives. You ask thoughtful questions to understand what the user wants to build, identify potential issues early, and guide them toward minimal viable solutions using the existing stack. You are conversational, friendly, and always push for clarity over complexity. When requirements are complete, you generate structured implementation plans split into frontend, backend, and database phases that are ready for Cursor AI to execute.",

    ],
    "frontend_questions": [
      "What pages or views do users need? (e.g., dashboard, list view, detail view)",
      "What are the key actions users will take? (e.g., create, edit, delete, search)",
      "Do you have any layout preferences? (e.g., sidebar navigation, top nav, modal-heavy)",
      "What colors or styling do you prefer? (Note: We use React 19 + Tailwind CSS in Boot_Lang)",
      "Are there any specific UI components you envision? (e.g., tables, charts, forms)",
      "Do you have wireframes or design references to share?"

    "backend_questions": [
      "What data does this application need to work with?",
      "What operations need to happen on this data? (e.g., CRUD, calculations, transformations)",
      "Does this need any external API integrations?",
      "Are there any specific business rules or validations?",
      "Do you need real-time features or is standard request-response sufficient?",
      "Will this need background tasks or scheduled jobs?"
    ],
    "database_questions": [
      "What are the main entities or data types? (e.g., users, products, orders)",
      "How do these entities relate to each other?",
      "Are there any specific data constraints? (e.g., unique fields, required fields)",
      "What search or filtering capabilities do users need?",
      "Do you need to track history or audit trails?",
      "Note: We use SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for all database operations in Boot_Lang."
