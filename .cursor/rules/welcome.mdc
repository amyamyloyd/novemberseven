# Welcome Script Rules - SaltAIr Onboarding

## When User Says "Run the Welcome Script" or "Run welcome.bat"

### Step 1: Check Python Installation

**ALWAYS check if Python 3.11+ is installed BEFORE running the script:**

```bash
python --version
```

**If Python is NOT installed or not in PATH:**

1. **Install Python using Windows Package Manager:**
   ```powershell
   winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12
   ```
   
2. **Wait for installation to complete** (monitor output or wait 30-60 seconds)

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   Must show Python 3.11.x or 3.12.x

4. **If verification fails:**
   - Check if Python was added to PATH
   - May require restarting terminal/Cursor
   - If still failing, manually guide user to python.org/downloads

### Step 2: Run welcome.bat

**Once Python is confirmed installed:**

The file is `welcome.bat` in the repository root.

**CRITICAL - On Windows, run in CMD (not PowerShell):**
```cmd
cmd /c welcome.bat
```

**If already in CMD:**
```cmd
welcome.bat
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Script checks if setup server is running on port 8001
- If not running, starts `python setup_server.py` in background
- Opens browser to http://localhost:8001/setup
- If already running, just opens browser

**IMPORTANT:** The setup will auto-install GitHub CLI and Azure CLI if missing via `winget`.

### Step 3: Monitor for Errors

**If script fails with "Python not found":**
- Go back to Step 1 and install Python

**If script fails with port conflict:**
- Check what's using port 8001: `netstat -ano | findstr ":8001"`
- Kill the process or use different port

**If browser doesn't open:**
- Tell user to manually visit: http://localhost:8001/setup

### Step 4: Next Steps After Setup Form

**After user submits the setup form:**
- The form triggers `automation.sh` automatically
- Monitor for completion (15-20 minutes)
- User will see Welcome screen when done

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** skip the Python check - it will always fail without it
- **DO NOT** assume Python is installed on fresh Windows machines
- **ALWAYS** verify Python version after installation
- The script handles server startup automatically - don't manually start `setup_server.py` unless the script fails

## Alternative Commands User Might Use

- "run welcome script" → Run welcome.bat
- "start setup" → Run welcome.bat  
- "open setup form" → Run welcome.bat
- "run the welcome script" → Run welcome.bat

All of these should trigger the same flow: Check Python → Install if needed → Run welcome.bat
